WordPress Test Template
=========================

A robust and GPL-licensed code template for creating a standards-compliant WordPress plugin.


## Why this template?

Because we're using it at the Automattic Grand Meetup 2016.

After the GM, it'll be deleted and you can go directly to [Hugh Lashbrooke's template](https://github.com/hlashbrooke/WordPress-Plugin-Template).
